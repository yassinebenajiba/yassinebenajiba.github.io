	<h2>Factfullness</h2><br>
	I think there are two important aspects to this book: the content and the perspective:<br>
	<h3>- Content:</h3><br>
	Throughout the book, the author brings again and again statistical data around many high stake issues for humanity to show that we are often delusional about the direction in which the whole world is going. That is to say, we often mistakenly think that the world is going in a negative direction when it comes to issues such as healthcare, education, poverty, etc. That is due primarily to our inclination to almost always overdramatize the situation and to the fact that we don't bother to check the latest data and update our overview of what progress is humanity making.<br>
	To show us how much update we need and how big is the gap between our overview and the reality of the world, the author chose a list of multiple choice questions around the aforementioned issues. At the beginning of the book, the reader is invited to give their own answers. The rest of the book, goes about detailing point by point what is happening in the world and the reader is slowly brought to be aware of how much progress is happening that they are not aware of.<br>
	How did the author choose to organize this data? Instead of organizing them by subject or sector, a much smarter compartementalization is taken by the author, namely, by human instinct. That is to say, the book is trying to walk the reader through a set of biases that are common to all humans and look at the data through that bias. A truly brilliant idea. So for example, there is a chapter around the 'linear progress' bias. That is our instinct to presume that if something has been progressing along a line so far, it will continue to do so forever. We as humans tend to fall into the mistakes of employing such bias in the wrong place when, for instance, we are forecasting the earth population for the next 100 year, wheares a much better forecast is that the numbers will flatten at a certain point, the same way the height of a person flattens after a certain age, because of the dynamics.<br><br>
	<h3>- Perspective:</h3><br>
	What is brilliant about this book is that there is a new perspective that grows in the reader's mind as they keep going through its chapters. As the author insists on shedding light on how we are biased towards taking a negative perspective on our most pressing issues, and as he keeps feeding the reader data that show how positive is the outlook on those same issues, the reader feels how their perspective switches little by little. This is one of the key reasons why it is important to read this book from cover to cover patiently. It is not just to learn more data about the world's population, public healthcare and education, it is rather to let their perspective become transformed by the book. And to encourage the reader to take that step and switch perspective, he relates personal stories to show that he has been in the same camp before and how that was hurtful to their life experience. This makes the message much stronger.<br><br>

	Finally, I would like to say that there is a secondary effect to that change of perspective. If a reader agrees that they have experience the same shift in experience as the one I am describing here, they will surely agree with me that this is immediately followed by a realization that once we look at the world from a standpoint of hope everything looks extremely different. Most of the things that we don't like look as temporary and thus patience follows automatically. The way you would plan for your life, the way you'd plan for the future and the way you'd relate to next generations is completely different when we are in a 'doom' versus a 'hope' mindset. And the only way to be in a 'hope' mindset is no better than using data to gain perspective on where we started, what have we improved and where we are. What is possible tomorrow then comes on its own because the trend is clear once an insightful person like Hans takes you by the hand to show you an image of the world that is more grounded that the one filtered by your built-in biases.
